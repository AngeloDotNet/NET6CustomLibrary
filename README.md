# NET6 Custom Library

Collection of tools mostly used in my private and/or work projects thus avoiding the duplication of repetitive code.

## :dvd: Installation

The library is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NET6CustomLibrary) or run the following command in the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package NET6CustomLibrary
```

## :memo: Library documentation

> **Note:** The methods marked deprecated are permanently removed in library version 1.0.201 but can be used with an updated implementation, using this library (*CustomLibrary.EFCore*) already available on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CustomLibrary.EFCore)

The documentation is divided for each extension method, and can be consulted by clicking [here](https://github.com/AngeloDotNet/NET6CustomLibrary/blob/main/src/NET6CustomLibrary/Docs/).

In addition to the implementations listed above, the library includes dependencies to the MassTransit, AutoMapper packages.
